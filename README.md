# .dotfiles

Backup of configuration files.

Run the link_all.sh script to link the configuration files to the places they are commonly stored on a new machine.

NOTE: This script is very basic and appends source commands to .zshrc. repeatedly running this script will add duplicate lines to .zshrc.
